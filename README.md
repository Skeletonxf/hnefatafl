## Building the Jetpack Compose GUI app

[jextract](https://github.com/openjdk/jextract) and Java 21 or later must be installed. The path to the jextract needs to be provided in `ui/local.properties`. A normal `cargo build` will generate the `bindings.h` file from the Rust sources. Once this is generated, building the Jetpack Compose app will generate the Java glue code using the Foreign Function & Memory API of Project Panama. Afterwards the JVM app can be ran normally, and it will use the shared object from the built cdylib Rust code.
